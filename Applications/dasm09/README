Lightly modified to compile and run under Fuzix by Brett M. Gordon 2017:

- original loads entire image to a buffer and dasms from there.  I
redefined the low-level macro to call read functions that read
directly from a FILE stream.  A 32K userspace would have a hard time
with large images using the original method!

test.asm is assembled using a09 by L.C. Benschop
(AS09 has a bug in direct jump at least in amiga version)
test2.asm is assembled using AS09 (V1.04 amiga) by Frank A. Vorstenbosch.

dasm09 is tested on vbcc (V0.7 amiga), dice (V0.16 amiga)
Borland C++ (V5.02 Win95) and lcc-win32 (V?.? 15.5.1998 Win95)
(gcc V2.7 should work too)
