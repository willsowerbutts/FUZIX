Internal working tree for the replacmeent of ubasic

- Ideas

Put the start of the workspace above the end of the biggest of interpreter
and editor, add a fixed entry point to each and we can then treat them as
overlays with a common header stub!

- Compiler

- Expressions

Fix FOO(bar,baz)

Make PI and RND not functions but constants

Parse FN X as a special type of function and also FN X(y)



Strings

need to push ptr to string and length in calc (so we can treat "foo" and
A$ the same way)

temporary strings go just below the return stack as we don;t change that
during anything with string variables.

Note: GOSUB expr will result in an eval to an integer thus removing any string
temporary need *before* the stacking.


Ecma-55 requires unique to two letters. So given case doesn't matter we could
pack variables with a 16bit lead tag as

[5.first][6.second]		(A0-A9 AA-ZZ]
[type.2]
00				number
01				spare
10				fornext
11				string
1/0				array/non array
[dims.2]			number of array dims  (1-4)

lead byte 0 = end (because would be variable '@@'

Then we can pack vars as

[type/code.w]
[value]

or for array or string

[type/code.w]
[totalsize]
[lengths.w * n]  (0 if non array)
[data]


which means our search becomes

	while (*ptr && (*(uint16_t *)ptr & LOW11) != seek) {
		if (ptr[1] & SIZED)
			ptr += *(uint16_t *)(ptr + 2);
		else
			ptr += 2;	/* 2 or 5 if fp basic)
	}
